CSS counters are a powerful feature for creating automatically incremented numbers on your webpage, making them great for things like numbering lists, sections, or custom elements without manually updating the HTML. They’re versatile, flexible, and can add both structure and style to your content. In this post, we’ll explore how CSS counters work, how to set them up, and several practical examples to make your projects more dynamic.

## What are CSS Counters?

CSS counters allow you to keep track of the number of times an element is used in your code and display it visually. They’re perfect for numbering items automatically, especially when working with dynamic content. The main CSS properties we’ll use to work with counters are:

- `counter-reset`: Initializes or resets a counter.
- `counter-increment`: Increases the counter value by a set amount (typically by 1).
- `content: counter()`: Displays the counter value, typically within `::before` or `::after` pseudo-elements.

With these three properties, you can define and manage counters to keep track of items or sections without additional JavaScript or HTML adjustments.

## Setting Up a Basic Counter

Let’s start with a basic example of creating numbered headings in a list. Here’s how you’d set up a CSS counter to display numbers beside each heading.

### Step 1: Initialize the Counter with `counter-reset`

To begin, we need to initialize the counter on a parent element, setting it up with `counter-reset`.

```css
/* Initialize the counter on the parent element */
.container {
  counter-reset: section-counter;
}
```

### Step 2: Increment the Counter with counter-increment

Next, on each child heading, use counter-increment to increase the counter each time it’s displayed.

```css
h2 {
  counter-increment: section-counter;
}
```

### Step 3: Display the Counter with `content: counter()`

Finally, use `content: counter()` within a `::before` pseudo-element to display the incremented counter for each heading.

```css
h2::before {
  content: counter(section-counter) ". ";
  font-weight: bold;
}
```
